# Automated Data Analysis Report

## Analysis Narrative

Based on the provided dataset summary, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis that includes insights and recommendations. Given the context, we can assume the dataset contains various metrics related to well-being across different countries and years. 

### 1. Data Overview

- **Rows and Columns**: The dataset consists of 2363 rows and 11 columns.
- **Columns**: Key indicators include `Country name`, `year`, `Life Ladder`, `Log GDP per capita`, and various social metrics like `Social support`, `Freedom to make life choices`, etc.
  
### 2. Missing Values Analysis

- **Missing Values**: 
  - The dataset reports varying percentages of missing data across columns:
    - `Log GDP per capita`: 1.18%
    - `Social support`: 0.55%
    - `Healthy life expectancy at birth`: 2.67%
    - `Freedom to make life choices`: 1.52%
    - `Generosity`: 3.43%
    - `Perceptions of corruption`: 5.29%
    - `Positive affect`: 1.02%
    - `Negative affect`: 0.68%
  
- **Recommendation**: Address missing values through imputation or removal based on their impact on analysis. For low percentages, mean/mode imputation may be sufficient.

### 3. Outliers Analysis

- **Outliers**: Several columns display a significant number of outliers:
  - `Social support`: 48 outliers
  - `Healthy life expectancy at birth`: 20 outliers
  - `Generosity`: 39 outliers
  - `Perceptions of corruption`: 194 outliers
  
- **Recommendation**: Investigate the reasons behind outliers, particularly in `Perceptions of corruption`, which has a high count. Depending on the analysis, consider robust statistical methods that are less impacted by these outliers.

### 4. Statistical Tests & Distribution Properties

- **Normality Tests**: All tested variables (Life Ladder, Log GDP per capita, etc.) do not follow a normal distribution, as evident from low p-values.
  
- **Recommendation**: Non-parametric statistical methods should be employed for further analysis and hypothesis testing since the assumptions for normality are not met.

### 5. Key Insights

- **Trends Over Time**: The dataset spans multiple years (19 unique years), suggesting that it could be useful for time-series analysis. For instance, trends in `Life Ladder` scores or `Log GDP per capita` might reveal insights into how well-being has evolved globally.
  
- **Country Comparison**: There are 165 unique countries; comparative analysis could highlight which countries score highest/lowest in different metrics, providing insights into global inequalities in well-being.

### 6. Recommended Visualizations

- **Box Plots**: To visualize the distribution and identify outliers across key metrics (Life Ladder, Social support, etc.).
  
- **Line Charts**: Display trends in `Life Ladder` and `Log GDP per capita` over years for specific countries.
  
- **Heatmaps**: Show correlations among variables to identify how they interact with each other.
  
- **Bar Charts**: Comparison of well-being metrics among countries.

### 7. Final Recommendations

- Conduct further analysis with an emphasis on imputing missing values and addressing outliers sensitively.
- Consider advanced analyses like regression models to understand relationships between GDP and happiness.
- Engage in exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visual tools to derive more context about the data.
- Based on findings, set up a separate analysis focusing on the top and bottom countries in each key metric to derive actionable insights.

### Example Visualizations (Pseudocode)

This isn't executable code but represents how one might visually analyze the data using Python's `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries.

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Box plot for Life Ladder
sns.boxplot(x='Life Ladder', data=data)
plt.title('Box Plot of Life Ladder Scores')
plt.show()

# Line plot for GDP Over Time
for country in data['Country name'].unique()[:5]:  # Display for first 5 countries
    country_data = data[data['Country name'] == country]
    plt.plot(country_data['year'], country_data['Log GDP per capita'], label=country)

plt.title('Log GDP per Capita Over Years')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Log GDP per Capita')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Correlation heatmap
correlation = data.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion

Through a well-structured approach to analyzing the data,
